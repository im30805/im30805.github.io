Hello there, my name is Lau Yi Meng. I made this site to compile my academic and professional experiences.

I am a Software Engineering graduate from Monash University Malaysia. At the time of creating this site, I don't have a specialty just yet, so I am currently exploring what I would like to do. From my experiences so far, I seem to lean more towards the backend side of software development, or just supporting the process in general (i.e. DevOps).

As for hobbies, I guess I like to play video games and the piano. I am not good at either one but I enjoy them a lot.

Even though this is a blog-centric website, I probably would make a few posts and never again... I am not one to really write about things, let alone use social media to create content. Despite that, I do have some experiences I would like to share here I suppose. For now, I just use it to display the projects I had done / was involved in thus far.

There may not be much, but I hope you enjoy your time here fellow visitor. Thanks for visiting! <br>
